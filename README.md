# Schymatics
Project is currently undergoing rennovation (slowly - have been travelling and generally away from my computer recently!) 

| **GitHub Page** | **[schyler-evans.github.io/schymatics-web](https://schyler-evans.github.io/schymatics-web/)** |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| **Production** | **[schymatics.com](https://schymatics.com/)** |

## Plan
Re-build as a general portfolio site. In addition to streamlining the CI/CD and content hosting process, I am enjoying designing a minimalist approach to the layout and UX. Will use it to display painting, modeling, and photography projects.

## Stack
- Hosting: AWS Lightsail
- Server: Windows, IIS
- Front: React, Styled Components, Jest
- Back: TBD, seperate project
- Database: TBD
- CI/CD: Automated test/build/deploy-to-github-pages on push, deploy-to-AWS on workflow dispatch. Automated versioning and release branch cutting.
